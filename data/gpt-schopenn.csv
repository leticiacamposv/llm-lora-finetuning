Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.","Value of Time and Daily Routine"

"Our life is a loan received from death with sleep as the daily interest on this loan.","Life and Death"
"Nature shows that with the growth of intelligence comes increased capacity for pain, and it is only with the highest degree of intelligence that suffering reaches its supreme point.","Intelligence and Suffering"
"Optimism is not only a false but also a pernicious doctrine, for it presents life as a desirable state and man's happiness as its aim and object. Starting from this, everyone then believes he has the most legitimate claim to happiness and enjoyment. If, as usually happens, these do not fall to his lot, he believes that he suffers an injustice, in fact that he misses the whole point of his existence.","Critique of Optimism"
"If God made the world, I would not be that God, for the misery of the world would break my heart.","God and the Misery of the World"
"What disturbs and depresses young people is the hunt for happiness on the firm assumption that it must be met with in life. From this arises constantly deluded hope and so also dissatisfaction. Deceptive images of a vague happiness hover before us in our dreams, and we search in vain for their original. Much would have been gained if, through timely advice and instruction, young people could have had eradicated from their minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer them.","Disillusionment with Life"

"Religions are like fireflies. They require darkness in order to shine.","Nature of Religions"
"That human life must be some kind of mistake is sufficiently proved by the simple observation that man is a compound of needs which are hard to satisfy; that their satisfaction achieves nothing but a painless condition in which he is only given over to boredom . . .","Human Life as a Mistake"
"The greatest wisdom is to make the enjoyment of the present the supreme object of life; because that is the only reality, all else being merely the play of thought. On the other hand, such a course might just as well be called the greatest folly: for that which in the next moment exists no more, and vanishes utterly, like a dream, can never be worth a serious effort.","Enjoyment of the Present"
"The deep pain that is felt at the death of every friendly soul arises from the feeling that there is in every individual something which is inexpressible,peculiar to him alone,and is, therefore,absolutely and irretrievably lost.","Pain of Loss"
"Men are the devils of the earth, and the animals are its tormented souls.","Human Cruelty to Animals"
"The bad thing about all religions is that, instead of being able to confess their allegorical nature, they have to conceal it.","Critique of Religions"
"Genius is its own reward; for the best that one is, one must necessarily be for oneself. . . . Further, genius consists in the working of the free intellect., and as a consequence the productions of genius serve no useful purpose. The work of genius may be music, philosophy, painting, or poetry; it is nothing for use or profit. To be useless and unprofitable is one of the characteristics of genius; it is their patent of nobility.","Nature of Genius"
"Life without pain has no meaning.","Meaning of Pain in Life"
"Students and scholars of all kinds and of every age aim, as a rule, only at information, not insight. They make it a point of honour to have information about everything, every stone, plant, battle, or experiment and about all books, collectively and individually. It never occurs to them that information is merely a means to insight, but in itself is of little or no value.","Information vs. Insight"

"Hatred is an affair of the heart; contempt that of the head.","Hatred vs. Contempt"
"Suicide may also be regarded as an experiment - a question which man puts to Nature, trying to force her to answer. The question is this: What change will death produce in a man's existence and in his insight into the nature of things? It is a clumsy experiment to make; for it involves the destruction of the very consciousness which puts the question and awaits the answer.","Suicide as an Experiment"
"It is a clear gain to sacrifice pleasure in order to avoid pain.","Sacrifice for Avoiding Pain"
"One should use common words to say uncommon things.","Simplicity in Expression"

"The world is not a factory and animals are not products for our use.","Animal Rights and Utilitarianism"
"Life is a business that does not cover the costs.","Economic View of Life"
"The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short.","Selective Reading"

"However, for the man who studies to gain insight, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.","Purpose of Study"
"No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change means progress.","Fallacy of Progress"
"Our civilized world is nothing but a great masquerade. You encounter knights, parsons, soldiers, doctors, lawyers, priests, philosophers and a thousand more: but they are not what they appear - they are merely masks... Usually, as I say, there is nothing but industrialists, businessmen and speculators concealed behind all these masks.","Masquerade of Society"

"Our first ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than fact.","Influence of Fiction on Life"
"If the lives of men were relieved of all need, hardship and adversity; if everything they took in hand were successful, they would be so swollen with arrogance that, though they might not burst, they would present the spectacle of unbridled folly-nay, they would go mad. And I may say, further, that a certain amount of care or pain or trouble is necessary for every man at all times. A ship without ballast is unstable and will not go straight.","Necessity of Hardship"
"Human life, like all inferior goods, is covered on the outside with a false glitter; what suffers always conceals itself.","Appearance vs. Reality"
"There is only one inborn error. and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy.","Inborn Error of Happiness"

"Materialism is the philosophy of the subject who forgets to take account of himself.","Critique of Materialism"
"Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.","Nature of Intellect"
"Just as one spoils the stomach by overfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and choke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.","Overloading the Mind"
"There are two things which make it impossible to believe that this world is the successful work of an all-wise, all-good, and at the same time, all-powerful being; firstly, the misery which abounds in it everywhere; and secondly, the obvious imperfection of its highest product, man, who is a burlesque of what he should be.","Imperfection of Creation"

"If a man wants to read good books, he must make a point of avoiding bad ones; for life is short, and time and energy limited.","Selective Reading"
"We seldom speak of what we have but often of what we lack.","Focus on Lack"
"It would be better if there were nothing. Since there is more pain than pleasure on earth, every satisfaction is only transitory, creating new desires and new distresses, and the agony of the devoured animal is always far greater than the pleasure of the devourer.","Pessimistic View of Life"
"There is only one inborn erroneous notion ... that we exist in order to be happy ... So long as we persist in this inborn error ... the world seems to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of maintaining a happy existence ... hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear the expression of ... disappointment.","Inborn Error of Happiness"
"Rudeness is better than any argument; it totally eclipses intellect.","Value of Rudeness"
"Patriotism is the passion of fools and the most foolish of passions.","Critique of Patriotism"

"Every nation ridicules other nations, and all are right.","National Ridicule"
"First the truth is ridiculed. Then it meets outrage. Then it is said to have been obvious all along.","Stages of Truth Acceptance"
"It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility, is just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a counter--an avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be stingy.","Importance of Politeness"
"With health, everything is a source of pleasure; without it, nothing else, whatever it may be, is enjoyable...Health is by far the most important element in human happiness.","Importance of Health"

"Many books serve merely to show how many ways there are of being wrong, and how far astray you yourself would go if you followed their guidance. You should read only when your own thoughts dry up.","Value of Reading"
"I am often surprised by the cleverness, and now and again by the stupidity, of my dog; and I have similar experiences with mankind.","Observations of Cleverness and Stupidity"
"Every satisfaction he attains lays the seeds of some new desire, so that there is no end to the wishes of each individual will.","Endless Desires"
"Pantheism is only a polite form of atheism.","Critique of Pantheism"
"Style is the physiognomy of the mind. It is more infallible than that of the body. To imitate the style of another is said to be wearing a mask. However beautiful it may be, it is through its lifelessness insipid and intolerable, so that even the most ugly living face is more engaging.","Nature of Style"
"There is in the world only the choice between loneliness and vulgarity. All young people should be taught now to put up with loneliness ... because the less man is compelled to come into contact with others, the better off he is.","Loneliness vs. Vulgarity"

"The man never feels the want of what it never occurs to him to ask for.","Unrecognized Desires"
"Restlessness is the hallmark of existence.","Restlessness of Existence"
"Man may have the most excellent judgment in all other matters, and yet go wrong in those which concern himself; because here the will comes in and deranges the intellect at once. Therefore let a man take counsel of a friend. A doctor can cure everyone but himself; if he falls ill, he sends for a colleague.","Limitations of Self-Judgment"
"Animals learn death first at the moment of death;...man approaches death with the knowledge it is closer every hour, and this creates a feeling of uncertainty over his life, even for him who forgets in the business of life that annihilation is awaiting him. It is for this reason chiefly that we have philosophy and religion.","Human Awareness of Death"
"Men best show their character in trifles, where they are not on their guard. It is in the simplest habits, that we often see the boundless egotism which pays no regard to the feelings of others and denies nothing to itself.","Character Revealed in Trifles"
"Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal.","Eternity of Change"
"That a god like Jehovah should have created this world of misery and woe, out of pure caprice, and because he enjoyed doing it, and should then have clapped his hands in praise of his own work, and declared everything to be very good-that will not do at all!","Critique of Creation"
"Exaggeration of every kind is as essential to journalism as it is to dramatic art, for the object of journalism is to make events go as far as possible.","Role of Exaggeration in Journalism"
"Life is short and truth works far and lives long: let us speak the truth.","Importance of Speaking the Truth"
"I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself from above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man.","Growth of Women Beyond the Mass"
"Every parting gives a foretaste of death, every reunion a hint of the resurrection.","Parting and Reunion"
"Whatever torch we kindle, and whatever space it may illuminate, our horizon will always remain encircled by the depth of night.","Limited Illumination"
"To forgive and forget means to throw away dearly bought experience.","Critique of Forgiveness"
"Because Christian morality leaves animals out of account, they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere 'things,' mere means to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing, and shines forth with inscrutable significance from all eyes that see the sun!","Critique of Christian Morality"
"The nobler and more perfect a thing is, the later and slower it is in arriving at maturity. A man reaches the maturity of his reasoning powers and mental faculties hardly before the age of twenty-eight; a woman at eighteen.","Maturity"
"There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed, but to be overcome; to be got over.","Purpose of Life"
"How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do.","Limitations of Human Intellect"
"To desire immortality is to desire the eternal perpetuation of a great mistake.","Critique of Immortality"
"There is not much to be got anywhere in the world. It is filled with misery and pain; if a man escapes these, boredom lies in wait for him at every corner. Nay more; it is evil which generally has the upper hand, and folly that makes the most noise. Fate is cruel and mankind pitiable.","Pessimistic View of Life"
"Whoever wants his judgment to be believed, should express it coolly and dispassionately; for all vehemence springs from the will. And so the judgment might be attributed to the will and not to knowledge, which by its nature is cold.","Expressing Judgment"
"Our moral virtues benefit mainly other people; intellectual virtues, on the other hand, benefit primarily ourselves; therefore the former make us universally popular, the latter unpopular.","Moral vs. Intellectual Virtues"
"Imagination is strong in a man when that particular function of the brain which enables him to observe is roused to activity without any necessary excitement of the sense. Accordingly, we find that imagination is active just in proportion as our sense are not excited by external objects. A long period of solitude, whether in prison or in a sick room; quiet, twilight, darkness-these are the things that promote its activity; and under their influence it comes into play of itself.","Conditions for Imagination"
"The first forty years of life give us the text; the next thirty supply the commentary on it.","Life's Text and Commentary"
"To attain something desired is to discover how vain it is; and though we live all our lives in expectation of better things, we often at the same time long regretfully for what is past. The present, on the other hand, is regarded as something quite temporary and serving only as the road to our goal. That is why most men discover when they look back on their life that they have the whole time been living ad interim, and are surprised to see that which they let go by so unregarded and unenjoyed was precisely their life, was precisely in expectation of which they lived.","Living in Expectation"
"The fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason is 'Anything perceived has a cause. All conclusions have premises. All effects have causes. All actions have motives.'","Principle of Sufficient Reason"
"Politeness is a tacit agreement that people's miserable defects, whether moral or intellectual, shall on either side be ignored and not be made the subject of reproach.","Purpose of Politeness"
"Human existence is an error...it is bad today and every day it gets worse, until the worst happens.","Human existance"
"The little incidents and accidents of every day fill us with emotion, anxiety, annoyance, passion, as long as they are close to us, when they appear so big, so important, so serious; but as soon as they are borne down the restless stream of time they lose what significance they had; we think no more of them and soon forget them altogether. They were big only because they were near.","Triviality of Incidents"
"I have long held the opinion that the amount of noise that anyone can bear undisturbed stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity and therefore be regarded as a pretty fair measure of it.","Noise Tolerance and Mental Capacity"
"If a relationship is perfectly natural there will be a complete fusion of the happiness of both of you-owing to fellow-feeling and various other laws which govern our natures, this is, quite simply, the greatest happiness that can exist.","Natural Relationship and Happiness"
